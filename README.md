# omegga-playtime
This is a Omegga plugin that lets you know how long you've played on a server, and the first time you've joined it after this plugin is installed!
View initial join and total playtime for yourself or others.

Known bugs:

-Leaderboard does not show real-time playtime, only updates on leave (will attempt to fix later)

-Leaving by crashing will not update your leave.

Do '!help K-Playtime' in-game to view what you can access
